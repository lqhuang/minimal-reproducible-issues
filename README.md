# My minimal reproduceable examples for issues in various libraries.

Each individual example is layout in different branches, so you can check out the branch that corresponds to the issue only you are interested in.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lqhuang/minimal-reproducible-issues --single-branch --branch <branchname>
```

- `staging-with-case-class-and-circe`: for [circe/circe PR#2083](https://github.com/circe/circe/pull/2083)
- `nested-objects-interop-between-scala-java`:

Create new orphan branch to add new example:

```sh
git checkout --orphan <branchname>
git clean -nx
```
